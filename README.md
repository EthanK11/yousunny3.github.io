Hi everyone! My name is Sunny You and I am currently enrolled at Lehigh University. I am planning on majoring in computer science because of how much my computer science teacher in High School has influenced me. I've had experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript and my most recent was Java. 

This page will contain my portfolio for the Data Journalism class.
